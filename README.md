# GameRoom

Terminal based RPG game created by Abbie Thompson titled "The Game Room."

Project 2 of CPSC 1050.

This game allows the user to roam the Game Room and play a variety of games including Blackjack, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Magic Squares, Rock Paper Scissors, Number Guesser, and Word Jumble. The user must start at the Blackjack table, but they are then able to stay or jump from table to table by request through the Game Master. The number of times each game is played is recorded and saved to a json file, which is displayed once the user exit's the Game Room.

The user may exit the game by typing "exit" instead of choosing their next table. 

Have fun and enjoy!

To play, begin by entering "python GameRoom.py" in the terminal.
